With a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from ETH Zurich, I have a strong foundation in signal processing, computational modeling, and neuroscience. During my Master’s thesis at Harvard Medical School, I applied network theory on calcium imaging data to ascertain neural connectivity in autism mouse models. I also optimized our lab’s connectivity computation code, reducing processing time from over 8 hours to just 12 minutes by leveraging linear algebra and SciPy's matrix functions.
