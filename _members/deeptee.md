I am a postgraduate student of Psychology at the University of Delhi with a comprehensive academic background in research methodology, statistics, and psychometrics. My training spans both quantitative and qualitative approaches, covering core areas such as developmental, social, clinical, and cognitive psychology. I am deeply engaged with the theoretical and empirical dimensions of the discipline and maintain a sustained interest in academic research.
