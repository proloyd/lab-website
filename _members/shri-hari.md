After completing M.Sc. in Psychology, I'm working as a research assistant at the intersection of psychology and neuroscience, with a focused interest in cognitive processes and cognitive control. My job involves studying higher order cognitive phenomena, developing experimental paradigm to investigate the variables of cognitive flexibility, collecting comprehensive neuro-behavioural data through reaction-time, EEG & MRI recordings and exploring novel data analysis tools to derive meaningful, scientific results.
