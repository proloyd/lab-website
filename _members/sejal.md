I have a background in Biotechnology with training in both experimental biology and data analysis, and I am currently a PhD student working under Dr. Proloy. My research interests lie in computational neuroscience, with a focus on signal processing and time-series analysis of neural imaging data. I am particularly interested in studying the dynamics of cognitive flexibility and task switching, and in developing interpretable models that help extract meaningful structure from complex neural signals.
