I have an interdisciplinary background in nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, and computational physics, with applications ranging from biological and mechanical systems to astrophysical sources. My Ph.D. work modeled the nonlinear dynamics of branched structures, while my postdoctoral research at IUCAA used recurrence analysis and machine learning to analyze binary star systems and detect precursor signals in transients. My interests center on understanding emergent behavior in complex systems.
